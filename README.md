### Hey there! 👋

I’m [**Kuro**](https://kurocodes.netlify.app/), a full-stack web developer who enjoys building clean, interactive, and thoughtful web experiences.

I like turning ideas into real, usable products — from smooth frontend interactions to reliable backend systems.

My main stack includes **React**, **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Tailwind CSS**, with a strong focus on performance, animations, and developer experience. I enjoy working with motion and micro-interactions to make interfaces feel alive.

You’ll find a mix of UI experiments, reusable components, and full-stack projects in my pinned repositories.

Outside of coding, I enjoy anime (action, romance, slice of life) and occasionally share dev-related content
